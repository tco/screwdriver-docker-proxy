Install boot2docker
-------------------
- https://github.com/boot2docker/osx-installer/releases/latest
- https://docs.docker.com/installation/mac/

○ → boot2docker init
○ → boot2docker up

- Follow instructions

○ → docker run hello-world

- Should print:
“Hello from Docker.
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.”


Building a Docker container
---------------------------

○ → docker build -t screwdriver-docker-proxy .
○ → docker run --name screwdriver-docker-proxy -P screwdriver-docker-proxy

- You can attach to a running image with
○ → docker exec -it screwdriver-docker-proxy bash


Perparing the certificate
-------------------------

Many certificate providers will provide you with .crt files. Amazon only
takes the certificates as pem format, so they need to be transformed.

1. Make the key and signing request

○ → openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout screwdriver.cc.key -out screwdriver.cc.csr

- This will generate two files, key and csr. Send the singing request to the SSL Authority and
  wait for your certificate to arrive

2. Transform the crt to pem (if needed)

○ → openssl x509 -inform PEM -in screwdriver.cc.crt > screwdriver.cc.pem

3. Transform the certificate chain to pem (if needed)

○ → (openssl x509 -inform PEM -in COMODORSADomainValidationSecureServerCA.crt; openssl x509 -inform PEM -in COMODORSAAddTrustCA.crt; openssl x509 -inform PEM -in AddTrustExternalCARoot.crt) > screwdriver.chain.pem

4. Save these to Amazon and you're ready to go
